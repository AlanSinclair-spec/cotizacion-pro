# CotizaciónPro - Quick Start Guide

## You just built your first SaaS MVP! 🎉

This is a complete quote generator app for Mexican contractors. Here's what you have:

### ✅ Features Built
1. **Landing Page** - Simple, mobile-first homepage in Spanish
2. **User Authentication** - Signup and login with email/password
3. **Dashboard** - Clean interface with "Create Quote" button
4. **Quote Creator** - Form with auto-calculations (subtotal, IVA 16%, total)
5. **Quote Display** - Professional-looking quote optimized for screenshots
6. **WhatsApp Sharing** - Share button using native mobile share API
7. **Auto-save** - Forms save to localStorage (works offline)

### 🚀 Next Steps to Launch

#### 1. Set Up Supabase (15 minutes)
Follow the instructions in `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`:
- Create free Supabase account
- Get your API keys
- Run the SQL to create database tables
- Add keys to `.env.local`

#### 2. Test Locally
```bash
cd cotizacionpro
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 and test:
- Create account
- Create a quote
- View the quote
- Take a screenshot

#### 3. Deploy to Vercel (10 minutes)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Then deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

#### 4. Get Your First Customer (This week!)
- Share with 1-2 contractor friends
- Ask them to test it
- Get feedback
- Iterate

### 💰 Monetization (Add Later)
For now, focus on getting users. Add payments when you have 10+ active users:
- Stripe for international payments
- Mercado Pago for Mexico
- Start with manual invoicing if needed

### 📱 Mobile Optimization
Your app is already optimized for:
- Cheap Android phones (minimal JavaScript)
- Slow internet (aggressive caching, small bundle)
- Spanish language only
- Large touch targets (48px minimum)
- WhatsApp green color scheme (familiar)

### 🔧 Files Overview

**Pages:**
- `/` - Landing page
- `/registro` - Sign up
- `/login` - Login
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/crear-cotizacion` - Create quote form
- `/cotizacion/[id]` - View quote

**Configuration:**
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Mobile-first styling
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Database client
- `.env.local` - API keys (create this!)

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"supabase is not defined"**
→ Create `.env.local` with your Supabase keys

**"quotes table does not exist"**
→ Run the SQL in SUPABASE_SETUP.md

**Styles not loading**
→ Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

**TypeScript errors**
→ Run: `npm run build` to check for errors
